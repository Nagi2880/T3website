Build a website with 3 tiered user system: Super Admin, Account Admin, Agent, and Client.



superadmin is able to login to admin portal (url = /admin)
superadmin user and password is hardcoded in the app
superadmin is able to create account along with the owner user (account admin)



account admin is able to login to their portal (url = /tenant)
account admin is able to create multiple agent users



agent is able to login to their agent portal (url = /tenant/agent)
agent is able to create multiple client users



client is able to login to the client portal (url = /tenant/client)



each user type can only access the url associate to thier type:
superadmin = /admin
account admin = /tenant/admin
agent = /tenant/agent

After login a simple welcome message is sufficient.
